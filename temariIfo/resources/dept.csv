"
42,7,AAU Department of Statistics,4,"One of the most interesting features of these programs was their flexibility. Students who performed well in the certificate program could continue to the diploma level. The same was true for transfer from diploma to degree program. The reverse was also true i.e., students who performed poorly were advised to join a lower level program. In 1973, the Statistical Training Center was upgraded to the Department of Statistics and it has been running the degree program for regular students and the diploma program for extension students since then. In 1974, the certificate program was terminated. In 1975 the diploma program was confined to the extension division only."
