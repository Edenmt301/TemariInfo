1,1,Business and Economics Accounting(CBE),034 441 0964,ia.director@mu.edu.et ,"The College of Business and Economics (CBE hereafter) is one of the pioneer colleges of the Mekelle University. To briefly describe CBE in perspective, CBE is the brainchild of the School of Economics. The School of Economics was established in 1987 in the librated area of Tigray during the struggle with the military regime. Following the downfall of the military junta in 1991, the school of economics was upgraded to the college level wherein the then school of economics was named by Mekelle Business College. Then, the college started its operation by enrolling 150 students in its different diploma programs with 16 academic and 20 support staff members."
